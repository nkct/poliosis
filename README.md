# poliosis
poliosis is a 2D, vector-graphics, city-builder game.

It is written in rust and uses the [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) graphics library.  
The game aims to present a dystopian world characterised by few morals and a cruel disdain for human life, while delivering a challangeing and, at times, stressful experience to the player.  
All by the medium of minimalistic graphics and fun gameplay.  

It is still in very early stages of developement.
